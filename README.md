# Gleam Changelog

For no particular reason I broke down the changelogs by category (Bug Fix, Compiler, ...) for every release and visualised them.

Disclaimer: this is totally arbitrary and does not consider the effort put into each changelog entry.

Nevertheless I think it's fun to look at. The team is definitely not slowing down!
